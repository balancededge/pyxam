# Pyxam
Recreation of the R exam package functionality in python. After development details? head over to the 
[docs](https://rawgit.com/balancededge/pyxam/master/docs/build/0_index.html).
## Introduction
This readme is a WIP.

## Dependencies
In order to use Pyxam effectively you will need:
 - A LaTeX compiler
 - The exam, minted, lineo packages for LaTeX
 - pygments for minted
 - Python 3.3 or later
 - Numpy
 - Matplotlib
 - Pweave


## Installation
To install Pyxam download the files from Github either by cloning the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/balancededge/pyxam
```
Or by using the Github web interface and clicking the Download ZIP button in the upper right. After the project is 
cloned or the zip is unzipped navigate to the top level directory containing `setup.py`. In the command line run:
```bash
$ ./setup.py install
```
You may need to run the script with python and/or under superuser (sudo). Installing Pyxam will make the program 
available at the commandline via the bash script `pyxam` as well as any other python script by using `import pyxam`
