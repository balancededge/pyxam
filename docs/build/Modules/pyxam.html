This is the code documentation for the Pyxam Exam module. For details on installation and usage checkout the
[readme](https://github.com/balancededge/pyxam).

### Overview

Pyxam is a python library for building exams. Central to this task are three major features, format flexibility, version
independence, and python code weaving. Format flexibility means allowing exams to be written in a variety of formats and
easily exported to others. This may mean writing an exam in LaTeX and then exporting to HTM or writing an exam in Emacs
org mode and then exporting to Moodle. Version independence means providing ways of providing version specific
information within an exam. For instance you may want to include student information (such as their name or student
number). You may also want to generate different exam versions where questions have different parameters and answers,
but you do not want every student to have a different exam as that is to difficult to mark, instead you only want three
exams. Pyxam makes accomplishing this task easy. Python code weaving means that you can write Python code write in your
document and it will be run to produce specific parts of your exam. Access to an entire program language when creating
a document provides infinite flexibility so Pyxam provides a small API to help simplify the process.


 
This code documentation is broken into a few major sections. The [Getting Started](https://rawgit.com/balancededge/pyxam/master/docs/build/1_Getting_Started.html) page is where
you will want to head if you are new to Pyxam. The [Framework](https://rawgit.com/balancededge/pyxam/master/docs/build/Framework/0_index.html) pages provide an overview of the
general structure of Pyxam from a conceptual level. The [Changelog](https://rawgit.com/balancededge/pyxam/master/docs/build/Changelog/0_index.html) pages provide details on
version changes. The Modules and Plugin pages provide API documentation and links to source for the codebase itself. You
can search any of this content using the search bar on the side which will only show pages that match your search.

### Thanks

Pyxam is inspired by the [R exam package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exams/index.html) which used
[Sweave](https://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/), a tool for running inline R code in LaTeX documents, to generate
exams. Pyxam aims to bring similar functionality to inline Python code using [Pweave](http://mpastell.com/pweave/), a tool
that emulates Sweave for Python. Without the great work by these other parties Pyxam would not have been created.

<input type="hidden" id="0_index_md" value="# The Pyxam Framework

Pyxam is built on top of a set of structures that follow a consistent design pattern. Each of the following structures
takes ownership over a collection of implementations. Similar to interfaces in object oriented programming the primary
function of these structures is to call a function provided by their children.

This design model is implemented to allow for easy extensibility whilst maintaining a consistent set of core tools and
design principles. All of these structures can be added to via plugins which are loaded dynamically at runtime.

<input type="hidden" id="2_Process_List_md" value="# The Process List 
The process list is the highest level of the Pyxam process. The process list is simply a list of functions that are run
one after the other until the list is empty. Once empty Pyxam is finished and the program exits. This process list can be
changed at any time. You can add new functions to the list, remove functino, and reorder them at any point when Pyxam is
running. Additionally the return value of a function in the process list is used as the arguments for the next function
allowing information to be easily passed from one function to the next or transformed in between.  

The base process list along with a short description of each function is provided below:
 - `load_options` loads the command line options
 - `welcome` displays a welcome message
 - `load_plugins` loads all available plugins
 - `build_files` fixes paths and builds all necessary files
 - `run_commands` prepossesses commands in the template (see [bang](https://rawgit.com/balancededge/pyxam/master/docs/build/Modules/bang.html))
 - `post_status` posts the current state of all options
 - `weave` runs any inline code within the template
 - `parse` reads the template document into an intermediate format (see [formatter](https://rawgit.com/balancededge/pyxam/master/docs/build/Modules/formatter.py))
 - `compose` converts the intermediate format into the output format
 - `export` moves files from the tmp directory to the final out directory
 - `cleanup` removes all temporary files
 - `unload_plugins` unloads all available plugins
 - `goodbye` display a goodbye message

In order to hook into the process list there are three helper functions provided. These functions use the name of
processes to identify where you want to insert into the process list.
```python
# Run after another function
process_list.run_after('welcome', my_function)
# Run before another function
process_list.run_before('export', my_function)
# Inserting relative to your already inserted function will insert relative the first occurence
proces_list.run_before('my_function', my_function)
# Append a process or a list of processes to the end of the process list
process_list.append(my_function)
process_list.append([my_function, my_function])
```">

<input type="hidden" id="3_Plugins_md" value="# Plugins

Plugins are python files that are loaded dynamically during the `load_plugin` process and can run whatever code they
like during that time. To add a plugin simply add a `.py` file to the `plugins` folder. In order for the plugin to load
however it needs to have the proper signature. All plugins must have a `load` and `unload` function nd their `load`
function must return a signature with some meta information. This is to help ensure that only plugins are in the plugins
folder and automatically build documentation and command line options. An example of a simple plugin:
```python
# Plugin signature
plugin = {
        'name': 'example plugin',
        'author': 'ejrbuss',
        'description': 'An example plugin'
}

def load():
    # Put your plugin code here
    return plugin
    
def unload():
    pass

<input type="hidden" id="4_Formats_md" value="# Formats

Pyxam uses formats to parse files and compose them. They are simultanesouly the most complex and most powerful structure
in Pyxam. When parsing a format will be matched based on a provided list of compatible file extensions.Then the file will
have tokenized based off a set of tokens provided by the format. When exporting a tree of tokens is converted into raw
text by writing out your provided tokens. This means that a format specification allows that format to be imported into
any other format and exported into from any other format. An example of what a basic formatter looks like:
```python
# Add a format
formatter.add_format({
    # The name of the format
    'name': 'Format name',
    # A list of compatible extensions
    'extensions': ['extension'],
    # A set of processors that are run before and after the parsing/composing processes
    # They pass_through filter is a filter that does nothing to the input
    'parser_preprocessor': filter.pass_through,
    'parser_postprocessor': filter.pass_through,
    'composer_preprocessor': filter.pass_through,
    'composer_postprocessor': filter.pass_through,
    # Optional arguments that specify a right and left parentheses to respect when parsing
    'left_paren': '{',
    'right_paren': '}',
    # The list of tokens that specify this format
    # This is often specified with an OrderedDict if the order in parsing attempts are made 
    # is important.
    'format': collections.OrderedDict([
        # A token is composed of a name and a list which defines it.
        # This definition can contain strings. These will be matched directly.
        # The last item in the definition is a regex that speicifies the end of the token.
        # Whatever matches this regex will not be considered part of the token.
        ('basic token', ['Matches this string', '.']),
        # An empty tuple matches arbitrary content.
        # This content could be other tokens or just a pure string
        ('input', ['<tag denoting start of input>', (), '<tag denoting end>', '.']),
        # A token can reference other tokens and require they be a part of their content.
        # This reference is denoted by placing the token name inside a list.
        ('basic token and input', [['basic token'], ['input'], '.']),
        # If multiple token names are given in a list this acts as an or statement
        ('basic token or input' [['basic token', 'input'], '.']),
        # The tokens $ and verbatim are special because their contents are always raw strings
        # even if their content matches another token.
        ('$', ['The Following string will be raw', (), '.'])
    ])
})
```
Once a format is specified it can be used to construct an AST. The parsed and composed AST are viewable if the `-d`
debug option is given. They appear in the temporary folder. An example AST:
```
[
questions:
	question:
		multichoice:
			title:
				question
			prompt:
				Which of the following are even?
			choices:
				correctchoice:
					0
				choice:
					-45
				correctchoice:
					12
]
```
The `filters.py` file contains functions for working with the AST to prepare if for other formats.">

<input type="hidden" id="5_Selectors_md" value="# Selectors 

Selectors are used to mix a CSV file with various versions of an exam. They're details will be added later. Currently
there is only one selector.">

<input type="hidden" id="1_Options_md" value="# Options

Pyxam command line options are flexible and dynamic. All command line options added prior to the `_options.py` file will
be shown in the help message, and all options are parsed the moment they are available. This means you can add an option
in the same line of code where you test to see if the user has specified the option. In fact this is an intended usage
as the `add_option` function returns the value of the option. Below is an example of this design pattern:
```python
# The last two arguments are the default value and the type
if options.add_option('option_name', '-flag', 'A description', False, bool):
    # Run your plugin
```
In addition to parsing command line arguments options can also be overriden at anytime by accessing them through the
`state` object. This object maps the name of the option to a function that can be used to set the option and retrieve
its value. For example:
```python
# Add an option that gets a string from the user
options.add_option('your_name', '-yn', 'Please provide your name', 'N/A', str)
# An example of retrieving that string
name = options.state.your_name()
# An example of setting that string
options.state.your_name('Bob')
```
Options are extremely useful when trying to modify Pyxam's behavior with a plugin. Not only can you create your own and
use them as global variables, but by hooking into the process list before and after a function you can change the option
state that function runs in. This technique is used in the `format_pdf.py` plugin for example to make sure the template
file is composed as a LaTeX file despite the user specifying pdf as their output format.">

<input type="hidden" id="6_Inline_md" value="# Commands

Commands are special strings that appear after `pyxam!` in comments of template files. These commands are written in
comments so that their appearance is universal regardless of the format they appear in. When a command is found the
entire comment is replaced with the return value of the command. Creating your own function is easy:
```python
# Create a command function
def hello_world_command():
    
    Command description
    
    print('Hello World')
    return ''
# Add the command
bang.add_command('hello_world', hello_world_command)
```
Usage in a file would look something like:
```
# pyxam!hello_world
```">

# Module pyxam

This is the primary script for Pyxam. This script can be run from the command line with Pyxam's options or run in api
mode from another python script. When run from the command line all command line arguments are passed to Pyxam and api
mode is automatically disabled. In addition to launching Pyxam this script is also responsible for welcome and goodbye
messages and tracking the Pyxam version number.



Prior to launching however script checks Python dependencies for `matplotlib` and `numpy` which are needed for
generating figure images as well as `pweave` which is needed for weaving inline Python code. Failing to meet one of
these dependencies will result in an exit statement and a recommendation todo `pip install` for the dependency.

     - `load_options` loads the command line options
     - `welcome` displays a welcome message
     - `load_plugins` loads all available plugins
     - `build_files` fixes paths and builds all necessary files
     - `run_commands` prepossesses commands in the template (see [bang](https://rawgit.com/balancededge/pyxam/master/docs/build/Modules/bang.html))
     - `post_status` posts the current state of all options
     - `weave` runs any inline code within the template
     - `parse` reads the template document into an intermediate format (see [formatter](https://rawgit.com/balancededge/pyxam/master/docs/build/Modules/parser_composer.py))
     - `compose` converts the intermediate format into the output format
     - `export` moves files from the tmp directory to the final out directory
     - `cleanup` removes all temporary files
     - `unload_plugins` unloads all available plugins
     - `goodbye` display a goodbye message
    Once added these processes are consumed until there are no more processes.

# Plugin _logging

This plugin is considered a core plugin (indicated by the underscore in its name) it should only be replaced or removed
if the user knows what they are doing.


This plugin sets the logging configuration for Pyxam. The default value for logging is hardcoded but a command line
option is added to allow the user to set the logging level at runtime. The [plugin_loader](https://rawgit.com/balancededge/pyxam/master/docs/build/Modules/plugin_loader) will
always load _logging first so that other Plugins can use logging
in their load functions.

# Plugin docs

The docs plugin is used to build local or Github documentation for Pyxam. Documentation is compiled automatically from
a combination of Python source files and markdown docs files into a set of HTML pages. Python docs are treated as
markdown snippets in files and are transformed from markdown to HTML using Pyxam's exam process. Being able to
regenerate the documentation at anytime is useful when changing plugins for instance and you want to be able to look at
a Plugin's documentation.
