\question[10] A unity feedback control system is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CP_unity} with a controller $C(s)$
and the plant $P(s)$. The closed loop must have $M_p \le 5$\% overshoot to a step input and
\[P(s) = \frac{1}{s(s+7)}    \]
\begin{parts}
    \part Draw the root locus
    \part Find the value of $K$ the proportional controller gain $C(s) = K$ for $M_p \le 5$\% overshoot
    \part Determine the rise time in part with the gain K from part (a) $t_r$
    \part Now replace the proportional control with a lead compensator of the form
    \[C(s) = K(\frac{s+z}{s+p})\]
    Choose the compensator's zero to be at $-10$ so $z=10$, that is, $C(s) = K(\frac{s+10}{s+p})$\\ Place the pole $p$
    such that: (i) $M_p = 5$\% overshoot and (ii) the rise time $t_r$ is reduced by a factor of 2 $t_r(new) =t_r/2$.
    Draw these requirements on the root locus
    \part Over plot the root locus and find the value of the pole $p$ and the corresponding gain $K$ of the lead
    control to achieve these overshoot and rise time requirements.
