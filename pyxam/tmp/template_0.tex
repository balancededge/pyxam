### Thanks

Pyxam is inspired by the [R exam package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exams/index.html) which used [Sweave](https://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/), a tool for running inline R code in LaTeX documents, to generate exams. Pyxam aims to bring similar functionality to inline Python code using [Pweave](http://mpastell.com/pweave/), a tool that emulates Sweave for Python. Without the great work by these other parties Pyxam would not have been created.
